# Dictionary web app solution

This is a solution to the [Dictionary web app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dictionary-web-app-h5wwnyuKFL). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## About the Project

The "Dictionary Web App" challenge was an exploration into crafting a web application that mimics the component-based architecture of React, but using vanilla JavaScript with DOM manipulation techniques.

Built with Vite for a rapid development cycle and styled with Scss for elegance, this project leverages the Dictionary API to fetch word definitions.

A custom state management system was implemented to handle the application's data flow, drawing inspiration from Redux but tailored to a more fundamental approach.

This web app not only serves as a functional dictionary but also as a showcase of how traditional web technologies can be pushed to emulate modern frameworks' capabilities.
